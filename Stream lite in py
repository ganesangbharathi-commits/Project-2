st.form("my_form"):
    name = st.text_input("Name")
    submit = st.form_submit_button("Submit")
4. Machine Learning Integration
Streamlit works perfectly with:

Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
PyTorch
Pandas
NumPy
You can upload a model and make predictions directly from the UI.

5. Auto Reload
Whenever you save your Python file, Streamlit automatically refreshes the app in the browser.
This makes development very fast and smooth.
